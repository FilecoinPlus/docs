# Getting started with Filecoin Plus

:::info

This page is currently a work in progress, and some information may be incomplete or subject to change. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to develop and refine our documentation.

## Clients

A client can go through a couple of different paths to get DataCap, depending on storage needs:

- `32 GiB`: Suitable for exploring and testing.
  - Choose an [automated verifier](/docs/resources.md#automated-verifiers) or request a direct datacap allocation from notaries using tools like <https://filplus.storage/apply>.
- `32 GiB` to `500 TiB`: Suitable for more advanced storage.
  - Create a request on the [filecoin-plus-client-onboarding](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-client-onboarding) repository and find notaries to approve the request.
- `500 TiB` to `5 PiB`: Suitable for large datasets.
  - Create a request on [filecoin-plus-large-datasets](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets) repository and find notaries to approve the request.

To learn what's next after receiving your first datacap allocation, see [client onboarding](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-client-onboarding#readme).

## Notaries

Getting started as a notary requires applying for notary elections through the governance repository. To learn more, see [guidelines on the application and selection process](https://github.com/filecoin-project/notary-governance/tree/main/notaries#application--selection-process).

## Storage Providers

As a storage provider, you might want to get added to the [Fil+ storage provider list](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-client-onboarding/blob/main/miners.md#list-of-miners-taking-fil-deals) to signal you accept verified deals.
