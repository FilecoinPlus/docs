## Deal

Two participants in the Filecoin network can enter into a deal in which one party contracts the services of the other for a given price agreed between the two. The Filecoin specification currently details storage deals (in which one party agrees to store data for the other for a specified length of time) and retrieval deals (in which one party agrees to transmit specified data to the other).

## Deal quality multiplier

This factor is assigned to different deal types (committed capacity, regular deals, and verified client deals) to reward different content.

## Deal weight

This weight converts spacetime occupied by deals into consensus power. Deal weight of verified client deals in a sector is called Verified Deal Weight and will be greater than the regular deal weight.

## Due diligence

## Filecoin address

A Filecoin address is an identifier that refers to an actor in the Filecoin state.

In the Filecoin network, an address is a unique cryptographic value that serves to publicly identify a user. This value, which is a public key, is paired with a corresponding private key. The mathematical relationship between the two keys is such that access to the private key allows the creation of a signature that can be verified with the public key. Filecoin employs the Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) signature scheme for this purpose.

## Multisig Actor

The Multisig Actor (or Multi-Signature Wallet Actor) is responsible for dealing with operations involving the Filecoin wallet.

## Sector quality multiplier

Sector quality is assigned on Activation (the epoch when the miner starts proving theyʼre storing the file). The sector quality multiplier is computed as an average of deal quality multipliers (committed capacity, regular deals, and verified client deals), weighted by the amount of spacetime each type of deal occupies in the sector.

## FIL

FIL is the name of the Filecoin unit of currency; it is alternatively denoted by the Unicode symbol for an integral with a double stroke (⨎).

## On-chain

On-chain actions are those that change the state of the tree and the blockchain and interact with the Filecoin VM.

## Off-chain

Off-chain actions are those that do not interact with the Filecoin VM.

## Quality-Adjusted Power

This parameter measures the consensus power of stored data on the network, and is equal to Raw Byte Power multiplied by Sector Quality Multiplier.

## Raw Byte Power

This measurement is the size of a sector in bytes.
