# Introduction to Filecoin Plus

## What is Filecoin Plus?

Filecoin Plus (Fil+) is a program created to incentivize the onboarding of useful data onto the Filecoin network. The Fil+ program adds a social and governance layer to the Filecoin network to verify client and data authenticity through a verification process.

The Fil+ verification process is multifaceted and can be automatic or manual depending on the [DataCap](reference/glossary#datacap) amount involved. With DataCap, a client can make verified deals with storage providers and have higher [quality-adjusted power](reference/glossary#quality-adjusted-power-qap) attached, making storage providers more likely to win rewards.
